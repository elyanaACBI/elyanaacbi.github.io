Explanation:   
Main Elements: <branches> serves as the main container. 
 
Child Elements: Each <branch> represents a specific location, containing <address>, <contact>, and <openingHours>. The <address> element includes <street>, <city>, <state>, and <mapLink>, while <openingHours> encompasses <weekday> and <weekend>. 
 
Role Assignment: The elements <street>, <city>, and <state> provide address details; <contact> gives the branch’s phone number, and <weekday> and <weekend> define the operational hours. The <mapLink> element contains a link to Google Maps for each location’s address. These components are essential for organizing information about each branch clearly and efficiently.
